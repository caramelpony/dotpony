# .pony - Domains for horses!

*This is a silly side project, hence the informality of the registry, but it functions all the same!*

### How do I register a domain?

Clone this repository, make an edit to the pony.zone file-, remembering to increment the serial, and add your domain + two nameservers,-and submit a pull request!

This will be updated with fancier info later on.
